            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 83 -->his Holineſſe to defend and preſerve the ſame, to hinder their proceedings and intentions in ſetling and eſtabliſhing true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in that Kingdome: the effects whereof have a long time ſucceeded according to their deſires; but the Policy and Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of that State perceiving the ſame, they then endeavoured to prevent, and annihilate their deſignes.</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, by accuſing and impeaching the Grand Inſtrument of practiſing and agitating their hinderance in the ſame, his little grace, and leſſe gracious, the Archbiſhop, or intended Patriarch of <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and confining him to his private lodging in his ſtrong Caſtle, and ſecure place of reſidence, the Tower; whereby hee became uſeleſſe to the reſt in perfecting their deſignes concerning that buſineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, the accuſation and impeachment of divers Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Adherents; and Allyances to that faction; the little <hi>Wren,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and many others, of great and enormous crimes, confining them likewiſe to ſeverall places, under the like Juriſdiction of the Black Rod, of ſecurity and ſafety.</p>
            <p n="3">Thirdly, the Grand Impeachment and accuſation of no leſſe then twelve of the greateſt Competitors of that ſaction, of no leſſe crimes then High Treaſon, for their perverſe and wicked practices; upon which they were alwaies confined to the ſeventh dayes ſociety of their Grand Patron, and Maſter Little <hi>Laud,</hi> in his Princely Palace the Tower; there to have reſidence for their ſecurity, during the pleaſure of the Prince of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the whole State now aſſembled in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">Fourthly, the putting downe the votes of Prelates, and their ſitting in Parliament, as a party in the Houſe of Peeres, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from them all Temporall Juriſdiction in any affaires of State, or Civill Government,</p>
            <p n="5">Fiftly, their endeavours to take away the Votes, and ſitting in Parliament, of Popiſh Lords, Alliances, and favourers of that faction.</p>
            <p n="6">Sixthly, their proceedings againſt ſcandalous and diſ-affected perſons of the Inferior Clergy, well minded towards that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and great defenders privately of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="7">Seventhly, the diſarming of all Popiſh Recuſants, whereby

            <p n="8">Eighthly, and laſtly, the putting of the Lawes of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in execution againſt his Holineſſe, the Spirits, Prieſts, and Ieſuites: whereby all hopes of inducement of his Majeſties good Subjects to ſide with them, and favour their cauſe, is quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
            <p>His Holineſſe having received certaine intelligence of theſe proceedings by the Parliament in <hi>England;</hi> at the receit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, his Holineſſe fell immediately into a deadly ſwoun; but by the help of his Magicians, Phyſitians, I would have ſaid: being recovered againe to his ſenſes, they then fell into conſultation, what meanes were beſt to be uſed to prevent a dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and generall plague that might fall by this misfortune, not only on the perſon of his Holineſſe, but on the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Idolatry; and at laſt concluded theſe remedies were beſt to be uſed for the ſtopping, and prevention of theſe future dangers threatned.</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, to raiſe Rebellion in his Majeſties Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of all that faction, againſt Proteſtants, and all that ſhall ſeeke the ruine and deſtruction of his Holineſſes Kingdome in that State.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, to ſend inſtruments of miſchiefe privately into <hi>England,</hi> to ſtirre up all Catholickes in that Kingdome to raiſe the like ſedition and Rebellion, to put into combuſtion and trouble that State alſo; whereby the Parliament being buſily employed in appeaſing ſuch mutinies, may neglect their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in ſetling true Religion, and aboliſhing Superſtition.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, to practice privately by treacherous Stratagems to bring to deſtruction divers worthy Peeres of that Kingdome, and Members of the Commons Houſe, that doe moſt labour and endeavour the extirpation of Popery, and all Popiſh and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Ceremonies, and corrupt Tenents in Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, innovated, and introduced into the Religion eſtabliſhed and ſetled in that Kingdome.</p>
